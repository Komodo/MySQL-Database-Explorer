*Requirements:*
You'll need to be using the Komodo IDE 6 or later.

*Installation:*
In Komodo, open the Tools > Add-ons dialog, then in the Get Add-ons tab search for mysql and then click on the mysql entry in the search results - install and restart. Once installed, MySQL will be one of the available databases to which you can add a connection to. Alternatively, you can install the add-on by downloading/saving the xpi file locally and then opening this xpi file from Komodo's File > Open dialog.

*Updates*
Version 0.3: Allow hostname to be a file path to local mysql.sock
Version 0.2: Use statically linked mysql library.
